## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: A metallic silver (#C0C0C0) for the dark theme to provide a modern, sophisticated look.
- Primary color: A lighter metallic silver (#D3D3D3) to highlight key interactive elements.
- Accent color: A subtle gray (#808080) to provide a complementary highlight, especially when the lighter silver may be too bright, in keeping with a futuristic style.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text, given its clean, modern aesthetic.
- Clean, grid-based layout with ample white space to achieve a minimalist and futuristic aesthetic.
- Use a set of consistent, simple, line-based icons that reflect a modern, tech-forward theme.
- Subtle transitions and animations for user interactions to enhance the futuristic feel. For instance, elements fade smoothly instead of popping.
